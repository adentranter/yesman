# Yes-man

##Why?
I suck at saying no, so i created a simple tool to help me make the choice.

##Demo
To view a running demo go to [sayno.adentranter.com](http://sayno.adentranter.com/).

##Building
Yesman is build on ember using ember-cli. So as long as you know your tools and have them installed, you will be golden.
Don't forget to run bower install && npm install.
